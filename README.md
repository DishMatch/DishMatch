## Summary

This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: An app that helps users decide what to cook by matching a protein or side dish with complementary recipes. Instead of browsing massive recipe websites, users receive curated pairings, step-by-step instructions, yields, and the ability to save favorites. Designed for simplicity and speed, DishMatch makes everyday cooking easier and more fun.
